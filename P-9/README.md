# TO-DO LIST

## Overview

This project is part of a React Practice series designed to enhance proficiency in building modern web applications using React. The P-9 folder contains the source code for a specific exercise, showcasing various features, technologies, and techniques utilized in React development.

## Features

- **Component-Based Structure**: The application is built using reusable components, making it easy to maintain and scale.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's state management capabilities through hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **Event Handling**: Demonstrates how to handle user interactions effectively with event listeners.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Implements conditional rendering techniques to display components based on application state.
- **Form Handling**: Includes forms with controlled components for managing user input.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Utilizes modern JavaScript features for cleaner and more efficient code.
- **CSS**: Styles the application using CSS for layout and design.
- **npm**: Node Package Manager used for managing project dependencies.

## Techniques

- **Hooks**: Leverages React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks for managing component lifecycle and state.
- **Props**: Uses props to pass data between components, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.
- **Routing**: Implements React Router for navigation between different views or components within the application.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is visually appealing across various device sizes using CSS media queries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd React-Practice/P-9
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can explore its features by interacting with various components. Observe how state and props are managed and how different components communicate with each other.
