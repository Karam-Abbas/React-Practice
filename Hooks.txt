1. **useState**: Manages the state of a variable. React doesn't automatically re-render for variable changes unless `useState` is used. It ensures React knows when the state changes and re-renders the component accordingly.

2. **useCallback**: Optimizes performance by memoizing functions. If a function causes unnecessary re-renders, `useCallback` ensures the function isn't recreated unless its dependencies change.

3. **useEffect**: Runs a function whenever specified dependencies change. Unlike `useCallback`, which prevents re-renders, `useEffect` ensures the function runs with every change in dependencies.

4. **useRef**: References a DOM element, like an input tag, without directly manipulating the DOM. It allows you to access and interact with the element inside and outside the component's return.
